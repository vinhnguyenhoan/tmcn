Need to highlight the differences between two images? Makes it easy with Twenty20 plugin.

== Description ==

Twenty20 is the WordPress plugin of TwentyTwenty script that developed by Zurb team.

This sparked a few new ideas on how to do something similar for our own needs. It had to swipe between two images to show "before" and "after". Most of all, it had to be responsive.
